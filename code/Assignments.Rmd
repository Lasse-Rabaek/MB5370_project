Caption:
Pie chart with information on transcription factor binding sites in the human chromosomes
Tried to show the proportion of binding sites found in different TFBS regions
Problems:
1. Pie charts are not the best way to show proportions, a bar chart would be better
2. The colors are quite jarring and don't go well together. Some pie charts also
show different colours on the sides than on the top due to shading
3. It is a 3D pie chart which is totally unnecessary and distorts the proportions
